Lines to remove from main_form.css to ensure sidebar uniformity:

Lines 1918-1946: Mobile sidebar media query conflicting with shared responsive.css
Lines 1962-1964: Sidebar box-shadow override
Lines 1969-1995: Sidebar-toggle and body.sidebar-open rules (conflicts with shared)
Lines 2706-2720: Sidebar-close button (not needed with shared component)
Lines 2732-2782: Complete sidebar responsive fixes section (conflicts with shared)
Lines 2799-2806: Sidebar padding and menu-item margin overrides

These should all be removed as the sidebar is now a shared component
controlled by:
- app/static/shared/css/sidebar.css
- app/static/shared/css/responsive.css
